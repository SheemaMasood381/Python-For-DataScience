    "     *  It can include any valid Python code, such as variable assignments, \n",
    "        conditional statements, loops, and function calls.\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Return statement:\n",
    "     *  It specifies the value(s) that the function should return to the \n",
    "        caller. \n",
    "     *  The return statement is optional. If omitted, the function returns \n",
    "        None. \n",
    "     *  You can return single values, multiple values (as a tuple), or even\n",

    "* Functions are a fundamental concept in Python programming and are widely used across various domains, including data science, software development, and automation. \n",
